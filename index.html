					My name is Mike Tallerico and I am a web developer. What you will find on this page is
					many projects that I have used to display what I have learned through my journey as a self
					taught developer. What started off as a hobby has turned into a full blown passion for
					code and web technologies. Whether you are here becuase of my resume or you are here to
					have me build you something really cool. I hope that this page gives you a glimpse as to
					what I am cabable of. What you wont see here is the many hours of dedication to learning
					various web technologies. I can assure you that that dedication will be carried over to
					your company or your project. Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio. If
					you have any questions at all please feel free to email, call or leave a comment below.
